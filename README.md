# FactorioScenarioMultiplayerSpawn
A custom scenario for allowing separate spawn locations in multiplayer. Designed for Co-op and PvE.

## Instructions
Download the zip.

Place it in your Factorio/scenarios/... folder

It should look something like this (for my windows steam install location):

C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Factorio\scenarios\FactorioScenarioMultiplayerSpawn\control.lua


## Configuration

Look in config.lua for some controls over the different modules.  

Not all configurations have been fully tested so modify at your own risk.


## TODO

I need to update this with more details about the implementation and explain some of the configuration options.

For now, just take a look at the source and it should be mostly easy to understand I hope.


## Credit

RSO is not my own creation. It was done by Orzelek. I requested permission to include it in my scenario.

Several other portions of the code (tags, frontier style rocket silo) have also been adapted from other scenario code.
